# Contributing Guide (Markdown-only)

only need to:
1) fork this repo
2) You might need to change `repo name` from `ZYnoe.github.io` to `YourUserName.github.io`
3) add / edit / delete Markdown files under `content/docs`
4) ```git add .```
5) `git commit -m "Comment Your changes"`

Bad Example vs Good Example
Bad: git commit -m "changes" — Too vague; others (or future you) won't know what or why it changed.

Good: git commit -m "Fix login button not responding on click" — Clear, specific, uses imperative mood (like a command), explains "what" and "why".

5) `git push`

GitHub Actions will build and publish the site automatically.
