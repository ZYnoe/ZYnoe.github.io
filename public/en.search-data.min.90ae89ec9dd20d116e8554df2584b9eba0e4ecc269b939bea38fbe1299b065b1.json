It builds a static website, so it loads quickly and does not need a server or database.\nGitHub Pages is free and easy to publish. Git also keeps a history of changes, so I can update tutorials safely and track what I changed over time.\nIn the near future, I may also post other topics I learn here as part of my study notes and summaries. But don’t worry—taxonomies (tags) will help me keep everything well organized by category.\n"}]
