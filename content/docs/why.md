# Why I Use Hugo + GitHub Pages for Materials Ontology Notes

I chose **Hugo** and GitHub Pages because they are simple, fast, and good for technical notes.

Hugo lets me write in Markdown and organize my Materials Ontology notes as clear pages. It builds a static website, so it loads quickly and does not need a server or database.

GitHub Pages is free and easy to publish. Git also keeps a history of changes, so I can update tutorials safely and track what I changed over time.

In the near future, I may also post other topics I learn here as part of my study notes and summaries. But don’t worry—**taxonomies** (tags) will help me keep everything well organized by category.
