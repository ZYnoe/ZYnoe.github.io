       "['Uniform tensile ductility (UTD) is crucial for the forming/machining capabilities of structural materials. Normally, planar-slip induced narrow deformation bands localize the plastic strains and hence hamper UTD, particularly in body-centred-cubic (bcc) multi-principal element high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which generally exhibit early necking (UTD\\u2009<\\u20095%). Here we demonstrate a strategy to tailor the planar-slip bands in a Ti-Zr-V-Nb-Al bcc HEA, achieving a 25% UTD together with nearly 50% elongation-to-failure (approaching a ductile elemental metal), while offering gigapascal yield strength. The HEA composition is designed not only to enhance the B2-like local chemical order (LCO), seeding sites to disperse planar slip, but also to generate excess lattice distortion upon deformation-induced LCO destruction, which promotes elastic strains and dislocation debris to cause dynamic hardening. This encourages second-generation planar-slip bands to branch out from first-generation bands, effectively spreading the plastic flow to permeate the sample volume. Moreover, the profuse bands frequently intersect to sustain adequate work-hardening rate (WHR) to large strains. Our strategy showcases the tuning of plastic flow dynamics that turns an otherwise-undesirable deformation mode to our advantage, enabling an unusual synergy of yield strength and UTD for bcc HEAs.',\n",
       " 'Dislocation motion, an important mechanism underlying crystal plasticity, is critical for the hardening, processing and application of a wide range of structural and functional materials. For decades, the movement of dislocations has been widely observed in crystalline solids under mechanical loading. However, the goal of manipulating dislocation motion via a non-mechanical field alone remains elusive. Here we present real-time observations of dislocation motion controlled solely by using an external electric field in single-crystalline zinc sulfide—the dislocations can move back and forth depending on the direction of the electric field. We reveal the non-stoichiometric nature of dislocation cores and determine their charge characteristics. Both negatively and positively charged dislocations are directly resolved, and their glide barriers decrease under an electric field, explaining the experimental observations. This study provides direct evidence of dislocation dynamics controlled by a non-mechanical stimulus and opens up the possibility of modulating dislocation-related properties.',\n",
       " 'Exciton–polaritons derived from the strong light–matter interaction of an optical bound state in the continuum with an excitonic resonance can inherit an ultralong radiative lifetime and significant nonlinearities, but their realization in two-dimensional semiconductors remains challenging at room temperature. Here we show strong light–matter interaction enhancement and large exciton–polariton nonlinearities at room temperature by coupling monolayer tungsten disulfide excitons to a topologically protected bound state in the continuum moulded by a one-dimensional photonic crystal, and optimizing for the electric-field strength at the monolayer position through Bloch surface wave confinement. By a structured optimization approach, the coupling with the active material is maximized here in a fully open architecture, allowing to achieve a 100\\u2009meV photonic bandgap with the bound state in the continuum in a local energy minimum and a Rabi splitting of 70\\u2009meV, which results in very high cooperativity. Our architecture paves the way to a class of polariton devices based on topologically protected and highly interacting bound states in the continuum.',\n",
       " 'Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) provide a standout platform for strong light-matter coupling with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) but have so far mostly been implemented as traditional all-dielectric metasurfaces with adjacent TMDC layers, incurring limitations related to strain, mode overlap and material integration. Here, we demonstrate intrinsic strong coupling in BIC-driven metasurfaces composed of nanostructured bulk tungsten disulfide (WS2) and exhibiting resonances with sharp, tailored linewidths and selective enhancement of light-matter interactions. Tuning of the BIC resonances across the exciton resonance in bulk WS2 is achieved by varying the metasurface unit cells, enabling strong coupling with an anticrossing pattern and a Rabi splitting of 116\\u2009meV. Crucially, the coupling strength itself can be controlled and is shown to be independent of material-intrinsic losses. Our self-hybridized metasurface platform can readily incorporate other TMDCs or excitonic materials to deliver fundamental insights and practical device concepts for polaritonic applications.',\n",
       " 'Photoinduced spin–charge interconversion in semiconductors with spin–orbit coupling could provide a route to optically addressable spintronics without the use of external magnetic fields. However, in structurally disordered polycrystalline semiconductors, which are being widely explored for device applications, the presence and role of spin-associated charge currents remains unclear. Here, using femtosecond circular-polarization-resolved pump–probe microscopy on polycrystalline halide perovskite thin films, we observe the photoinduced ultrafast formation of spin domains on the micrometre scale formed through lateral spin currents. Micrometre-scale variations in the intensity of optical second-harmonic generation and vertical piezoresponse suggest that the spin-domain formation is driven by the presence of strong local inversion symmetry breaking via structural disorder. We propose that this leads to spatially varying Rashba-like spin textures that drive spin-momentum-locked currents, leading to local spin accumulation. Ultrafast spin-domain formation in polycrystalline halide perovskite films provides an optically addressable platform for nanoscale spin-device physics.',\n",
       " 'The origin of nematicity in FeSe remains a critical outstanding question towards understanding unconventional superconductivity in proximity to nematic order. To understand what drives the nematicity, it is essential to determine which electronic degree of freedom admits a spontaneous order parameter independent from the structural distortion. Here we use X-ray linear dichroism at the Fe K pre-edge to measure the anisotropy of the 3d orbital occupation as a function of in situ applied stress and temperature across the nematic transition. Along with using X-ray diffraction to precisely quantify the strain state, we reveal a lattice-independent, spontaneously ordered orbital polarization within the nematic phase, as well as an orbital polarizability that diverges as the transition is approached from above. These results provide strong evidence that spontaneous orbital polarization serves as the primary order parameter of the nematic phase.',\n",
       " 'Conventional antiferroelectric materials with atomic-scale anti-aligned dipoles undergo a transition to a ferroelectric (FE) phase under strong electric fields. The moiré superlattice formed in the twisted stacks of van der Waals crystals exhibits polar domains alternating in moiré length with anti-aligned dipoles. In this moiré domain antiferroelectic (MDAF) arrangement, the distribution of electric dipoles is distinguished from that of two-dimensional FEs, suggesting dissimilar domain dynamics. Here we performed an operando transmission electron microscopy investigation on twisted bilayer WSe2 to observe the polar domain dynamics in real time. We find that the topological protection, provided by the domain wall network, prevents the MDAF-to-FE transition. As one decreases the twist angle, however, this transition occurs as the domain wall network disappears. Exploiting stroboscopic operando transmission electron microscopy on the FE phase, we measure a maximum domain wall velocity of 300\\u2009μm\\u2009s–1. Domain wall pinnings by various disorders limit the domain wall velocity and cause Barkhausen noises in the polarization hysteresis loop. Atomic-scale analysis of the pinning disorders provides structural insight on how to improve the switching speed of van der Waals FEs.',\n",
       " 'Ultralow thermal conductivity and fast ionic diffusion endow superionic materials with excellent performance both as thermoelectric converters and as solid-state electrolytes. Yet the correlation and interdependence between these two features remain unclear owing to a limited understanding of their complex atomic dynamics. Here we investigate ionic diffusion and lattice dynamics in argyrodite Ag8SnSe6 using synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering techniques along with machine-learned molecular dynamics. We identify a critical interplay of the vibrational dynamics of mobile Ag and a host framework that controls the overdamping of low-energy Ag-dominated phonons into a quasi-elastic response, enabling superionicity. Concomitantly, the persistence of long-wavelength transverse acoustic phonons across the superionic transition challenges a proposed ‘liquid-like thermal conduction’ picture. Rather, a striking thermal broadening of low-energy phonons, starting even below 50\\u2009K, reveals extreme phonon anharmonicity and weak bonding as underlying features of the potential energy surface responsible for the ultralow thermal conductivity (<0.5\\u2009W\\u2009m−1\\u2009K−1) and fast diffusion. Our results provide fundamental insights into the complex atomic dynamics in superionic materials for energy conversion and storage.',\n",
       " 'Experimental mapping of transmission is essential for understanding and controlling charge transport through molecular devices and materials. Here we developed a single-molecule photoelectron tunnelling spectroscopy approach for mapping transmission beyond the HOMO–LUMO gap of the single diketopyrrolopyrrole molecule junction using an ultrafast-laser combined scanning tunnelling microscope-based break junction set-up at room temperature. Two resonant transport channels of ultrafast photocurrent are found by our photoelectron tunnelling spectroscopy, ranging from 1.31\\u2009eV to 1.77\\u2009eV, consistent with the LUMO\\u2009+\\u20091 and LUMO\\u2009+\\u20092 in the transmission spectrum obtained by density functional theory calculations. Moreover, we observed the modulation of resonant peaks by varying bias voltages, which demonstrates the ability to quantitatively characterize the effect of the electric field on frontier molecular orbitals. Our single-molecule photoelectron tunnelling spectroscopy offers an avenue that allows us to explore the nature of energy-dependent charge transport through single-molecule junctions.',\n",
       " 'Carrier multiplication is a process whereby a kinetic energy of a carrier relaxes via generation of additional electron–hole pairs (excitons). This effect has been extensively studied in the context of advanced photoconversion as it could boost the yield of generated excitons. Carrier multiplication is driven by carrier–carrier interactions that lead to excitation of a valence-band electron to the conduction band. Normally, the rate of phonon-assisted relaxation exceeds that of Coulombic collisions, which limits the carrier multiplication yield. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by exploiting not ‘direct’ but ‘spin-exchange’ Coulomb interactions in manganese-doped core/shell PbSe/CdSe quantum dots. In these structures, carrier multiplication occurs via two spin-exchange steps. First, an exciton generated in the CdSe shell is rapidly transferred to a Mn dopant. Then, the excited Mn ion undergoes spin-flip relaxation via a spin-conserving pathway, which creates two excitons in the PbSe core. Due to the extremely fast, subpicosecond timescales of spin-exchange interactions, the Mn-doped quantum dots exhibit an up-to-threefold enhancement of the multiexciton yield versus the undoped samples, which points towards the considerable potential of spin-exchange carrier multiplication in advanced photoconversion.',\n",
       " 'In analogy to natural enzymes, an elaborated design of catalytic systems with a specifically tailored local chemical environment could substantially improve reaction kinetics, effectively combat catalyst poisoning effect and boost catalyst lifetime under unfavourable reaction conditions. Here we report a unique design of ‘Ni(OH)2-clothed Pt-tetrapods’ with an amorphous Ni(OH)2 shell as a water dissociation catalyst and a proton conductive encapsulation layer to isolate the Pt core from bulk alkaline electrolyte while ensuring efficient proton supply to the active Pt sites. This design creates a favourable local chemical environment to result in acidic-like hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics with a lowest Tafel slope of 27\\u2009mV per decade and a record-high specific activity and mass activity in alkaline electrolyte. The proton conductive Ni(OH)2 shell can also effectively reject impurity ions and retard the Oswald ripening, endowing a high tolerance to solution impurities and exceptional long-term durability that is difficult to achieve in the naked Pt catalysts. The markedly improved hydrogen evolution reaction activity and durability in an alkaline medium promise an attractive catalyst material for alkaline water electrolysers and renewable chemical fuel generation.',\n",
       " 'Adhesives are typically either strong and permanent or reversible with limited strength. However, current strategies to create strong yet reversible adhesives needed for wearable devices, robotics and material disassembly lack independent control of strength and release, require complex fabrication or only work in specific conditions. Here we report metamaterial adhesives that simultaneously achieve strong and releasable adhesion with spatially selectable adhesion strength through programmed cut architectures. Nonlinear cuts uniquely suppress crack propagation by forcing cracks to propagate backwards for 60× enhancement in adhesion, while allowing crack growth in the opposite direction for easy release and reusability. This mechanism functions in numerous adhesives on diverse substrates in wet and dry conditions and enables highly tunable adhesion with independently programmable adhesion strength in two directions simultaneously at any location. We create these multifunctional materials in a maskless, digital fabrication framework to rapidly customize adhesive characteristics with deterministic control for next-generation adhesives.']"
