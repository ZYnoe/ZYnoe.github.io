Structural and optical properties of structure are studied with scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, photoluminescence and UV–visible spectroscopy. Proposed geometry improves the extinction spectra and quenches photoluminescence in comparison to TiO2/Ag and SiO2/Ag/ZnO geometry. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations indicate a promising effect of the proposed geometries on thin-film solar cells. Twofold enhancement in total quantum efficiency of an optimized multilayer plasmonic graded-index thin-film solar cell is observed in comparison to the pristine solar cell.
