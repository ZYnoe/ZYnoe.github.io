      "['A Nd3+-doped transparent oxyfluoride glass ceramic containing Sr5(PO4)3F nanocrystals was prepared by melt quenching technique and subsequent thermal treatment. The phase and morphology of Sr5(PO4)3F nanocrystals were investigated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The volume fraction of Sr5(PO4)3F nanocrystals in the glass ceramic is about 12% and the fraction of Nd3+ ions incorporated in the Sr5(PO4)3F nanocrystals is about 15%. The peak absorption cross-section increases to 145% at 806nm and the full width at half maximum for the band around 806nm decreases from 12.5 to 11nm after the crystallization process. The 1059nm peak stimulated emission cross-section increases from 2.27×10−20 to 3.07×10−20\\n                     cm2 and the effective width for this band decreases from 35 to 30nm after the crystallization process. The improvement of spectroscopic properties indicates that the glass ceramic is potentially applicable as a 1.06μm laser material.', 'A pulsed laser deposited SiO2/Ag/ZnO/Ag/TiO2 multilayer structure is studied to enhance the light trapping capability of thin-film solar cell. Structural and optical properties of structure are studied with scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, photoluminescence and UV–visible spectroscopy. Proposed geometry improves the extinction spectra and quenches photoluminescence in comparison to TiO2/Ag and SiO2/Ag/ZnO geometry. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations indicate a promising effect of the proposed geometries on thin-film solar cells. Twofold enhancement in total quantum efficiency of an optimized multilayer plasmonic graded-index thin-film solar cell is observed in comparison to the pristine solar cell. Results suggest a more concerted study of multilayer plasmonic nanostructures with graded-index anti-reflection coatings to improve the performance of thin-film photovoltaic devices.', 'The solid-state 29Si n.m.r. spectra of two clathrasils, dodecasil-1H and dodecasil-3C, have been investigated. Spectra of as-synthesized and calcined samples differ considerably, which illustrates the sensitivity of n.m.r. to slight structural changes. A linear relationship between the chemical shifts and the mean Si\\ue5f8Si distance of the various silicon sites is found for these clathrasils.', 'ZnS thin films have been deposited by dip technique using succinic acid as a complexing agent. The structural and morphological characterizations of films have been investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope. X-ray pattern shows crystalline has hexagonal structure. The films show that good optical properties high absorption and band gap value was found to be 3.7eV. The specific conductivity of the film was found to be in order of 10−5 (Ωcm)−1 and showing n-type conduction.', 'The thermal properties of CaMgSi2O6 glass–ceramics with Al2O3 were investigated as a function of Al2O3 content. With increasing of Al2O3 content, the thermal conductivity of the sintered specimen was increased up to 4vol.% and then decreased, while the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was decreased up to 8vol.% and then increased. These results could be attributed to the crystallite size and rigidity of glass network, respectively. Typically, the thermal conductivity of 3.07W/m°C and/or the CTE of 8.76ppm/°C (25–600°C) was obtained for the specimens of CaMgSi2O6 with 4vol.% and/or 8vol.% of Al2O3 sintered at 900°C for 3h, respectively.']\n",
